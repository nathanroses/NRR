  <div class="about-mee">
    <h4>BORN IN EAST GRAND RAPIDS MICHIGAN</h4>
    <p>On November 3rd 2001 Where I Would Spend the Next 18 Years in That Exact Area. I Started Umpiring when I 
        was 14 at Southern Little Leauge while I attened Rockford North Middle School. I became the Most Paided 
        Umpire the year I took the job. I would not stop there then getting job offers from Celebration Cinema 
        and Texas Road House and landing with American Eagle in 2017. This was a Seasonal Position and Would come 
        to a Close at the end of the Holiday Season. This is when I took one of my best jobs to date at Chick Fil A. 
        I took this job and exceed in team leader skills and was able to tackle most every task they through at me. 
        Which eventually led me into a team lead role at chick fil a at the age of 16. I was also attending Rockford 
        High School at the time which I Graduated from in the year 2020. By this time I have worked for multiple 
        companies a golf course and wallgreens. This experience made me feel comfortable to make the leap out of
         my home town. </p>
